<h2>Description</h2>
This game was coded in python 3. I made 3 basic games <strong>"Rock, Paper, Scissors"</strong>, <strong>"Guess the number"</strong>, and <strong>"Magic 8 Ball"</strong> and made it into <strong>one game</strong>. The user gets to pick which game they want to play and can exit the chosen game to pick another game or exit the whole program.
<h3> Language Used:</h3>
 
 - Python 3
 
 <h3>Utilities Used:</h3>
 
  - Code With MU
  <h3>Python Modules Used:</h3>
  
   - Random

   <h3>Breakdown</h3>
   First, I made my own funtion to call for the player's name and for choosing which game to play portions of the game:

From there, I went on to define the functions for each individual game. Here is a screenshot of part of the <strong>Rock, Paper, Scissors</strong> game:

<br>
Lastly, I placed a <strong>if __name__ == "__main__"</strong>script at the bottom to run the script as the main program (in case i decide to come back and use the code as modules for an improved/expanded version of the game):
